- Terminate leases and automatically refund security deposits to tenants.
- Maintain logs of payments, withdrawals, and lease terminations.
- Provide access to rental property information, tenant details, and various logs.

## Usage

1. Create an instance of the `RentManagementSystem` class with the landlord's address.
2. Use the available methods to add rental properties, assign tenants, process payments, withdraw rent, and terminate leases.
3. Access the rental property information, tenant details, payment logs, withdrawal logs, and termination logs using the provided methods.

## Example

```python
# Create an instance of the RentManagementSystem
landlord_address = "0x123..."
rent_system = RentManagementSystem(landlord_address)

# Add rental properties
rent_system.add_property("Property 1", 1000, 500, "2024-05-10", landlord_address)
rent_system.add_property("Property 2", 1500, 750, "2024-05-15", landlord_address)

# Add tenants to properties
rent_system.add_tenant_to_property(1, "0xabc...", landlord_address)
rent_system.add_tenant_to_property(2, "0xdef...", landlord_address)

# Tenants pay security deposits and rent
rent_system.pay_security_deposit(1, "0xabc...", 500)
rent_system.pay_rent(1, "0xabc...", 1000)

# Landlord withdraws rent and terminates a lease
rent_system.withdraw_rent(500, landlord_address)
rent_system.terminate_lease(2, landlord_address)
